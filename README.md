# Control Your Lights And Stuff

>A php library aiming to facilitate quick development on a variety of different lights and bulbs.
>Includes support for WIFI enabled flux "Magic Home" lights and bulbs, very much inspired by [Daniel Hiversen python package](https://github.com/Danielhiversen/flux_led). Shout out to their package since they reverse engineered the whole thing.
